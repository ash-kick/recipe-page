## My process

I started with building out the HTML then moved on to adding the global CSS rules on a separate style sheet. Once I completed those I added specific CSS styles based on the page size.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned about padding application and having adaptable styles.
